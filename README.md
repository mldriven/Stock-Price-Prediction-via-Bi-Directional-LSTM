Project Task/Challenge : To build a prediction framework using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and especially Long-Short Term Memory model (LSTM) to predict future stock prices of HDFC.

Solution : The Bi-Directional LSTM model was assessed on a freely accessible dataset from yahoo finance including the historical stock prices of HDFC of National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. The project concluded that the Bi-Directional LSTM with 120 epochs, 2 dense layers, 50 LSTM units with a dropout percentage of 10 had the lowest MAPE of all.
