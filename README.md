# Stock-Price-Prediction-via-LSTM-and-Bi-Dirctional-LSTM
This project was associated with my thesis work for the master's degree in data science. The project proposed a comparative study between a Vanilla LSTM and a Bi-Directional LSTM model and highlighted the advantages of hybrid predictive models over standalone deep learning models. The models were assessed on a freely accessible dataset from yahoo finance including the historical stock prices of Tata Motors, HDFC, and Reliance of National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. The project concluded that the Bi-Directional LSTM with 120 epochs, 2 dense layers, 50 LSTM units with a dropout percentage of 10 had the lowest MAPE and outperformed the Vanilla LSTM model.
